## Coverage Testing Follow-up

1. **Rerun test with small dataset and manually confirm validation mode detects real problems**
   - Generate small dataset (2-3 records per entity)
   - Manually inspect CSV files to verify foreign key relationships are correct
   - Confirm validation mode is accurately detecting actual problems vs. false positives

2. **If generation or validation is not working correctly, determine why comprehensive tests missed this bug**
   - If generation mode is at fault, write a test to find that bug
   - If validation mode is at fault, write a test to find that bug
   - Analyze why our extensive test suite didn't catch this issue
   - Write focused tests to detect the root cause
   - **DO NOT change code** - only write tests to understand the problem

3. **Remove all debug output from the codebase**
   - Find and remove all DEBUG print statements
   - Clean up console output for production use
   - Ensure only intentional user-facing messages remain
