# Specification Quality Checklist: Per-Entity Row Count Configuration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items have been validated and pass inspection:

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification focuses on "what" and "why" without technical implementation details
- Written in business-friendly language describing user needs
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are well-defined with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions
- All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Success criteria include specific measurable metrics (e.g., "under 5 seconds", "90% of cases")
- Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes without implementation details
- Three prioritized user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios cover all primary flows
- Comprehensive edge cases identified (7 scenarios)
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions section documents all defaults and constraints

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2) and independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No leakage of implementation details (no mentions of Go, structs, packages, etc.)

## Notes

Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.
